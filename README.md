# Simple CRUD with React-Query

React Query makes fetching, caching, synchronizing and updating server state in your React applications a breeze.
React Query is hands down one of the best libraries for managing server state. It works amazingly well out-of-the-box, with zero-config, and can be customized to your liking as your application grows.

React Query allows you to defeat and overcome the tricky challenges and hurdles of server state and control your app data before it starts to control you.

On a more technical note, React Query will likely:

- Help you remove many lines of complicated and misunderstood code from your application and replace with just a handful of lines of React Query logic.
- Make your application more maintainable and easier to build new features without worrying about wiring up new server state data sources
- Have a direct impact on your end-users by making your application feel faster and more responsive than ever before.
- Potentially help you save on bandwidth and increase memory performance
